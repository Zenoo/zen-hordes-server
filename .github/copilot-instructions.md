# Project coding standards for TypeScript

## Code Style and Best Practices

- Never use default exports. Always use named exports with `export const`.
- Never use function declarations. Always use `const` with arrow functions.
- Never use the `any` type. All code must be fully type-safe.
- Use proper TypeScript types or type inference.
- Never use interfaces. Always use `type` instead.
- If the type is complex or unknown, use `unknown` and perform type guards/validation.
- Never use non-null assertions (`!`). Use proper null checks or optional chaining instead.
- Prefer explicit type guards and validation over type assertions.

## Performance

- Optimize for high concurrent request loads.
- Avoid blocking operations in request handlers.
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms.
- Minimize memory allocations and object creation in hot paths.
- Consider caching strategies where appropriate.
